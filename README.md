# data_mining_banking
Create a customer propensity model for a new product,
 specifically a line of credit against a householdâ€™s used car.
  Since the line of credit product is only in pilot, we need to identify the next 100 customers from a prospective customer list to contact. 


# Introduction 
Examine the historical data from 4000 previous 
calls and mailings for the line of credit offer. 
Using this historical data, and any supplemental data, 
create a propensity model, evaluate it and identify by 
uniqueID the top 100 households to 
contact from the prospective customer list. 
Additionally, bank executives are eager to 
learn more about the customer profile for h
historical and top prospective customers. 
As a result, variable importance and sound 
EDA will aid the presentation.
